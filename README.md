# Johnnycsp
our best project ever

download this stuff (both files) to your PC - path: C/xampp/htdocs/(create under any name)apcsp
then go in browser to localhost/apcsp (or the name you made up)
you should see a beutiful webpage, if not, check if xampp is running

open both the files and in index.php code it in a way it will look nice and it will send you to run.php page if you click that yes, I did run
most of the stuff needed should be in the two files, just use it where you need.. otherwise google what you need and Stackoverflow helps/ w3schools sometimes too
